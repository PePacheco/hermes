At first, I would do more testing and add a coordinator segue to see the details of every repository, but I lacked time and wanted to preserver the rule of only having 4 hours to complete the challenge.
I choose to not only use MVVM, but also use the Coordinator pattern to remove more responsibilities from the view controller, but at the end it was not used for it main purpose, which is to create and manage the navigation controller segues.
